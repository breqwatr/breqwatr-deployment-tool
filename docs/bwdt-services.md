# BWDT Services

The Breqwatr Deployment Tool orchestrates the deployment of a number of
services. In general, when BWDT refers to a service it's talking about an
application that's smaller in size and can run in one or only a few Docker
containers. Larger clustered application suites such as Ceph and OpenStack have
specialized commands and are not considered BWDT services.

BWDT supports the following services:

- [Local Apt Service](/apt.html)
- [Local Pip Service](/pip.html)
- [Local Docker Registry](/registry.html)
