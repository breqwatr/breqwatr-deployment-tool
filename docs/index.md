# Breqwatr Deployment Tool

A command-line driven deployment toolkit for containerized, open source cloud
services such as OpenStack and Ceph. BWDT supports other useful containerized
services which enable air-gap/dark-site installations such as private Apt and
Pip repositories.

The Breqwatr Deployment Tool (BWDT) enables an offline, reliable, and easy
installation procedure for what are otherwise highly complicated tools. The
services deployed by BWDT are tested, stable, and intended for long-term
support.

With the exception of a few value-add services, namely Arcus and Support, all
Breqwatr tools are free and open source. You can use BWDT to deploy OpenStack
and Ceph in your environment without purchasing a license, though the images
will come from Docker Hub instead of Breqwatr's registry and might be a bit
older.
